            <li>Did you know that a prospective <span class='highlight'>buyer decides within 20 seconds</span> if your home is for them? Twenty seconds is not very long to sell your most valuable asset.</li>
            <li>Did you know that every time a prospective buyer thinks a home needs a physical change; they typically <span class='highlight'>deduct $10,000</span> from the asking price?</li>
            <li>Did you know that a prospective buyer is more attracted to a home when the <span class='highlight'>furniture is properly set up?</span> Correctly setting up rooms will take the guess work out of where the potential buyer will put their furniture.</li>

        <h3><strong>Our Stress-free process:</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We start with a <span class='highlight'>one-to-one consultation</span> to meet you and your home.</li>
            <li>Together we generate a thorough "to do" list and prioritize the items that will bring the greatest return when selling your home. </li> 
            <li>We will discuss paint colors and any items that may need to be purchased to complete the staging design (shopping assistance provided with or without the client).</li>
            <li>We will develop a "<span class='highlight'>Home Staging Plan</span>," discuss <span class='highlight'>your budget</span> and <span class='highlight'>time frame</span>; no job is too big or too small (single room or entire home)</li>
            <li>From the plan, you may elect to do all the work yourself, or choose Redesign Right's stress-free full-service package that will create a "model like" home that is MLS and buyer ready in one day! </li>
        </ol>
        <p class='highlight'>Redesign Right specializes in making the home staging process affordable, stress-free and most importantly; effective in selling your home.</p>
