        <p>"When I find an outstanding Home Stager, I stick with her! Debbie Correale is that person. The goal is to create not only a great First Impression but also a lasting impression that will make the Buyer feel that they have found their ideal home. I call it the "'emotional pull" that comes when everything just feels Right. From furniture arrangement to the right colors, to the Right accessories, Debbie does it to perfection."</p>

She has boundless energy and a critical eye for detail.  I highly recommend her to anyone who wants to stand out from the rest in selling your home, or even if you are ready for an amazing new fresh look to your rooms.  You will be so glad that you chose her!"</p>

        <p>"Recently we had the pleasure of working with Debbie at Redesign Right. What she did to transform our two main living spaces is short of a miracle!  Although I did purchase some new decorative items to incorporate into the redesign, she was able to use a lot of things I already had which helped with our budget. I couldn’t be more thrilled with the results. Debbie made the whole process fun and exciting!  Would strongly recommend!!"</p>

First impressions and comfort are very important to our business and we wanted to create a room that met both expectations while showcasing our product lines.  Debbie started the design with what we already had, moved it, tweaked it, and gave us a very specific list of items to purchase. She created a room that exceeded our expectations and within our budget!

        <p>"I had Debbie come to help us decorate our townhome. I left a voicemail, and she called back very quickly. That was the first plus, as we had another designer never call back after coming for a consult. Another business we called never replied to my email. Next came my consultation at the end of May. Debbie is super warm and friendly and down to earth. She loves what she does, and I happen to love being around people who love what they do. She's super flexible with how involved you want her to be, and she's very upfront with pricing.</p>
        <p>She came to my home 6/13/17. My family and I left for several hours so she could work her magic. She made sure we were prepared and made sure that the things we loved the most would have a place in the new decor. When she called us to return home, we discovered that this poor lady had been moving furniture and hanging pics, etc., in 97 degree heat during a power outage. I had NO idea; she told me when I got home. So, no electricity, no a/c. In terrible heat. For 5 hours. She waved it off as if it were nothing (honey I KNOW it was rough). When I came home, I was welcomed to a GORGEOUSLY redesigned home. I can't say enough how perfect everything is. It truly reflects our style and personality, as well as our backgrounds. I just love it. This morning I woke up and just sat at my desk, admiring my amazing view. I highly, HIGHLY recommend Debbie for any of your staging or interior design needs. She will work with your budget and always has a great smile on her face. We're going to have her work with us for our outside needs next!"</p>

Last week’s class was the most intense, challenging, yet invigorating and motivating experience I have had in the past 30 years.

        <p>Debbie has impeccable taste and an incredible ability to envision how a space should be reconfigured and redesigned. She’s easy to work with and is always mindful of our budget. She is flexible in coming up with creative solutions and helping us prioritize, and I especially appreciated the times that she sat us down, explained the motivations behind her design choices, and was honest about the negative ramifications when we were about to deviate from the designed specs. Her honest guidance and advice helped us reach a better result than I could have imagined, and I know for sure that I will be contacting Redesign Right first and foremost for my future projects. We are truly enjoying the lovely home we've created together. It brings us beauty, comfort, and joy! I highly recommend her and am grateful for her continued support."</p>

        <p>"People say that I have a beautiful home, but I hadn’t re-decorated for 25 years – so it was a lovely 1990s home. I wanted a lovely 2020 home and didn’t know where to start. I needed everything from furniture to window treatments to rugs. When I first met Debbie, I asked her to be honest about the changes I needed to make. She was honest and confident, and that gave me confidence. I started by getting rid of things no longer needed and then moving existing items around. Debbie gave me a plan for buying new items, including a re-designed floor plan for my family room and living room. Four months later, I now have a lovely home for 2020 and beyond. Thank you, Debbie!"</p>

        <p>"I first saw Debbie’s work about six years ago, when she redesigned my girlfriends basement.  I was wowed when I saw the transformation.  It was a “work of art”, and very impressive. Several years ago I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment and hired Deb to redesign my space.  When I stepped into my apartment I was very pleased with the masterful and tasteful way she had gone about designing it. It was something right out of Home and Garden magazine. Debbie is a wonderful person with a bubbly personality and has an eye for color and flare. I love that she works with the things that are in your home and doesn’t have you go out and spend tons of money to give you the look that you want or even a look that you never thought of  but one  you’ll love  as soon as you see it. So, if you’re looking for an “Awesome” interior designer, look no further, Debbie’s the one for you, you won’t be sorry!"</p>

I have always been impressed with Debbie's professionalism, style and her "way" of relating to my clients. She has taken vacant properties in terrible locations and made them "staged to sell." Most of my listings sell quicker than other agents, I credit a lot of this to Debbie and her incredible talent that she has in her profession. She has also designed my home; I actually cried when I came home for the "reveal." Debbie takes what you already have and transforms your home using the special things that you already own and love!

        <p>"Once I realized that redesign was something I wanted to pursue, it was important to me to learn all about the art of redesign and home staging from someone who had a successful business and could teach me the basics.  Debbie has put together a couple of great training sessions that include both classroom instruction and hands on experience.  In the one week training program, each student participates in three different redesigns at clients’ homes so you can immediately apply the classroom theory to real situations. Doing three redesigns from start to finish not only gave me some work experience but confidence when it came time to do my first job alone.  I recommend Debbie’s training sessions to anyone who wants to learn the art of redesign and home staging."</p>

She has the ability to bring a “Wow Factor” to every home! She makes spaces look like the magazines, starting all designs with what you already own.  After seeing our home transformed, many of our friends have also created beautiful rooms through Debbie’s talent. When it came time to sell our home, she and her team came back and helped us prepare our home for sale (staging it). I had been told that staged homes sell faster and in our case that was true.  After our home was staged, the first person coming through the house made an immediate offer and insisted we sell them all the furniture, art and accessories in a few of the rooms as they did not want to disturb the way the rooms looked! I have since moved away from PA and have tried to entice Debbie to come to FL to help me in my new home as well!"</p>
