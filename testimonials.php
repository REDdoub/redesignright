        <p>"We wanted our client meeting room to fall in line with our brand and the quality level of services we provided. First impressions and comfort are very important to our business and we wanted to create a room that met both expectations while showcasing our product lines.  Debbie started the design with what we already had, moved it, tweaked it, and gave us a very specific list of items to purchase. She created a room that exceeded our expectations and within our budget!  Had we hired her from the beginning we would have saved not only time and aggravation but money as well.I personally as well as professionally cannot wait for the next project with her!"</p>

        <p>"I first saw Debbie’s work about six years ago, when she redesigned my girlfriends basement.  I was wowed when I saw the transformation.  It was a “work of art”, and very impressive. Several years ago I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment and hired Deb to redesign my space.  When I stepped into my apartment I was very pleased with the masterful and tasteful way she had gone about designing it. It was something right out of Home and Garden magazine. Debbie is a wonderful person with a bubbly personality and has an eye for color and flare. I love that she works with the things that are in your home and doesn’t have you go out and spend tons of money to give you the look that you want or even a look that you never thought of  but one  you’ll love  as soon as you see it. So, if you’re looking for an “Awesome” interior designer, look no further, Debbie’s the one for you, you won’t be sorry!"</p>

        <p>"The decorating in our home never felt "pulled together" until we worked with Debbie at Redesign Right.  She helped us to update our style by suggesting new pieces to work with our existing ones.  She helped us to select paint colors that complemented our furniture and window treatments.  Then she pulled it all together by adding accessories and arranging pictures.  Visitors to our home often said it looked like a magazine! When it was ultimately time to sell our home, Debbie advised us on the staging--the house sold in a week! We highly recommend Debbie at Redesign Right."</p>

        <p>"I attended Debbie’s 5 day Interior Redesign & Home Staging training, I walked away feeling that it was worth every penny.  I knew I had a true love for home design but I didn’t know how to approach starting my own business.  After the training I had enough confidence and knowledge to strategically market the business and to approach every project with a systematic design formula that works very time.  I thought that it was so beneficial that I recommended two of my friends to take Debbie’s training.  Best of all Debbie has a heart of gold and truly cares for her students and loves to develop lasting relationships."</p>

        <p>"I have had the pleasure of working with Debbie Correale from Redesign Right for almost five years. She designs and stages all of my listings. I have always been impressed with Debbie's professionalism, style and her "way" of relating to my clients. She has taken vacant properties in terrible locations and made them "staged to sell." Most of my listings sell quicker than other agents, I credit a lot of this to Debbie and her incredible talent that she has in her profession. She has also designed my home; I actually cried when I came home for the "reveal." Debbie takes what you already have and transforms your home using the special things that you already own and love! It is amazing. I have met and in the past worked with other stager-designers and I can honestly say, There is no one better out there than Debbie Correale!"</p>

        <p>"Debbie has been a tremendous asset as a home stager for my clients. By utilizing the home owner’s furnishings, and then adding her honest, enthusiastic approach, sellers are very appreciative and welcoming of her skilled advice. Her keen eye to detail for staging a home to sell has made all the difference in a home presenting at its very best, and a positive result is getting it sold sooner! I would highly recommend Debbie’s services."</p>

        <p>"Once I realized that redesign was something I wanted to pursue, it was important to me to learn all about the art of redesign and home staging from someone who had a successful business and could teach me the basics.  Debbie has put together a couple of great training sessions that include both classroom instruction and hands on experience.  In the one week training program, each student participates in three different redesigns at clients’ homes so you can immediately apply the classroom theory to real situations. Doing three redesigns from start to finish not only gave me some work experience but confidence when it came time to do my first job alone.  I recommend Debbie’s training sessions to anyone who wants to learn the art of redesign and home staging."</p>

        <p>"I had Debbie Correale from Redesign Right repurpose my house. What a phenomenal transformation! For less than the price of a sofa, she made several rooms look so much better than I ever could have imagined. The staging of the furniture made the room considerably more inviting.  I truly would be happy to speak with anyone who is considering using Redesign Right. It is by far the most fantastic, cost effective decorating decision I have ever made."</p>

        <p>"Debbie Correale totally redesigned our home numerous years ago and she continued to help us with many ongoing design decisions throughout the years. She has the ability to bring a “Wow Factor” to every home! She makes spaces look like the magazines, starting all designs with what you already own.  After seeing our home transformed, many of our friends have also created beautiful rooms through Debbie’s talent. When it came time to sell our home, she and her team came back and helped us prepare our home for sale (staging it). I had been told that staged homes sell faster and in our case that was true.  After our home was staged, the first person coming through the house made an immediate offer and insisted we sell them all the furniture, art and accessories in a few of the rooms as they did not want to disturb the way the rooms looked! I have since moved away from PA and have tried to entice Debbie to come to FL to help me in my new home as well!"</p>

        <p>"I had a meeting at my parent's house yesterday with Debbie to discuss pre-listing prep and staging to get ready to sell the property. I was extremely impressed with Debbie's knowledge, skill, professionalism and her genuine desire to be as helpful as possible. I have done some staging for my own rental properties and flips so I conceptually understand it, but I have to say Debbie blew me away with her plans, ideas and genuine passion for it. I've never before received such valuable and helpful information in a few short hours. If you are thinking of selling your home or are a Realtor that wants to work with an amazing professional that will surely increase the selling price of your home or listing, you need to get in touch with Debbie. She's simply amazing!"</p>
