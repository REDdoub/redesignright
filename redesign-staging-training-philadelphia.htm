        <p>The Certified 5-day Interior Redesign and Home Staging classes are intense, exciting and effectively equip the student with the foundations to start their own successful design and home staging business. The 5-day program is designed to educate, prepare and inspire confidence in students to start their own successful decorating business on day six. Classes are Monday-Friday or split over two weekends in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area. During the 5-day program, students will learn and observe through classroom and hands-on experience. Students will actively use their new skills as they decorate and redesign three different clients' homes. Upon completion of the 5-day program and testing, students will earn two certified designations:  FRSR Certified Interior Redesigner and FRSR Certified Real Estate Home Stager.</p>
